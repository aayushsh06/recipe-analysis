## Introduction  
This project explores recipe and user interaction data from **Food.com**, a major recipe-sharing platform. The dataset includes thousands of recipes, user-submitted ratings, and reviews dating back to 2008.

**Investigative Question:**  
**How can we predict the number of calories for a recipe in the dataset?**

---

## Why This Matters  
Understanding how recipe characteristics influence calorie count is important for:

- People managing their dietary intake  
- Home cooks aiming to prepare healthier meals  
- Nutritionists and dietitians creating meal plans  
- Developers building tools for calorie estimation or recipe recommendation  

By modeling calorie content based on recipe features, we can gain insight into which types of recipes and preparation methods contribute most to total caloric value.

## Dataset Overview  

We use two datasets from Food.com.

### Dataset 1: `RAW_recipes.csv`  
**Description:** Contains 83,782 recipes with ingredients, steps, and nutrition information.

| 1293707   | 40893     | 2011-12-21 | 5      | So simple, so delicious! Great for chilly fall evening. Should have doubled it ;)<br/><br/>Second time around, forgot the remaining cumin. We usually love cumin, but didn't notice the missing 1/2 teaspoon. |
| 126440    | 85009     | 2010-02-27 | 5      | I made the Mexican topping and took it to bunko. Everyone loved it.                                                                                                                                        |
| 57222     | 85009     | 2011-10-01 | 5      | Made the cheddar bacon topping, adding a sprinkling of black pepper. Yum!                                                                                                                                   |
| 124416    | 120345    | 2011-08-06 | 0      | Just an observation, so I will not rate. I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries. Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well. Sorry to report that the strawberries I used were disappointing. |
| 2000192946| 120345    | 2015-05-10 | 2      | This recipe was OVERLY too sweet. I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and just add on from there. Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries. |

Note: While this dataset helps understand user preferences, the primary focus for this analysis is on the first dataset, where the nutritional content is available.
